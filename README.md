# Info
This is my server on my custom gamemode (more optimized than darkrp)
You can use this to create your own server
To do it, you must to change some variables such as database (gamemodes\xilius\lib\database\sv_database.lua), general config file (gamemodes\xilius\lib\config\general.lua) and etc.

**DO NOT SELL OR RESELL THAT SERVER!**

# Issue
I'd recommend to delete anti-cheat system, cause it still in dev version and cannot be used as a good anti-cheat
